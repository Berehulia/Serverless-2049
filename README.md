# What is Serverless 2049?

It is a project to measure performance and runtime characteristics of Lambda functions written in different languages.

## Project structure
Each language specific implementation has its own dedicated directory and it is placed in the root of this repo.

Directory name represents the language and tech stack that was used (if required).

Example:
- `nodejs` - will contain Lambdas written with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
